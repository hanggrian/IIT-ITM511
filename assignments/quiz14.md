# Quiz 14: Resilience engineering

## Problem 1

> Which of the following are resilience activities involved in the detection of
  and recovery from system problems.
>
> - Resistance
> - Recovery
> - Recognition
> - Reinstatement

- Resistance
- Recovery
- Recognition
- Reinstatement

## Problem 2

> In designing a resilient system, you have to assume that system failures or
  penetration by an attacker will occur, and you have to include redundant and
  diverse features to cope with these adverse events.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**A.** True

## Problem 3

> You should not design operational processes to be flexible and adaptable
  because operators and system managers may sometimes have to break rules and
  "work around" the defined process.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**B.** False

## Problem 4

> ______ involves simulating possible system failures and cyberattacks to test
  whether the resilience plans that have been drawn up work as expected.
>
> 1. Asset classification
> 2. Resilience Testing
> 3. Threat recognition
> 4. Operational and management processes

**B.** Resilience Testing

## Problem 5

> Critical services are defined as services that are essential if a system is to
  ensure its primary purpose.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**A.** True

## Problem 6

> Cybersecurity is concerned with all of an organization's IT assets from
  networks through to application systems.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**A.** True

## Problem 7

> Resilience engineering does not focus on avoiding failure but rather on
  accepting the reality that failures will occur.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**A.** True

## Problem 8

> Fundamentally, resilience engineering is a technical rather than a
  sociotechnical activity.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**B.** False

## Problem 9

> Human error is rarely the cause of accidents in safety critical systems.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**B.** False

## Problem 10

> Resilience planning should be based on the assumption that ______ systems will
  be subjected to cyberattacks by malicious insiders and outisders and that some
  of these attacks will be successful.
>
> 1. offline
> 2. defensive
> 3. resilience planning should not be based on the assumptions
> 4. networked

**D.** networked
