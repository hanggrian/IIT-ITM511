## Problem 7

> Match the principle or practice with their correct descriptions.
>
> - Continuous integration
> - On-site customer
> - Collective ownership
> - Incremental planning

- **C.** The pairs of developers work on all areas of the system, so that no
  islands of expertise develop and all the developers take responsibility for
  all of the code. Anyone can change anything.
- **A.** As soon as the work on a task is complete, it is integrated into the
  whole system. After any such integration, all the unit tests in the system
  must pass.
- **D.** Requirements are recorded on "story cards," and the stories to be
  included in a release are determined by the time available and their relative
  priority. The developers break these stories into development "tasks."
- **B.** A representative of the end-user of the system (the Customer) should be
  available full time for the use of the XP team. In an extreme programming
  process, the customer is a member of the development team and is responsible

  and resolving requirements conflicts through negotiation.

  spiral. An early draft of the software requirements documents may be produced
  at this stage, or the requirements may simply be maintained informally on
  whiteboards, wikis, or other shared spaces.
