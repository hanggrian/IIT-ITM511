# Quiz 5-6: System modeling and architectural design

## Problem 1

> System modeling is the process of developing abstract models of a system, with
  each model presenting a different view or perspective of that system.
>
> 1. True
> 1. False

**A.** True

## Problem 2

> Which of the following options are NOT part of model-driven architecture?
>
> 1. A computation independent model (CIM)
> 1. A platform-independent model (PIM)
> 1. Platform-specific models (PSM)
> 1. Platform-Engineering models (PEM)

**D.** Platform-Engineering models (PEM)

## Problem 3

> Structural models may be either static or dynamic.
>
> 1. True
> 1. False

**A.** True

## Problem 4

> Architectural patterns are a means of reusing knowledge about generic system
  architectures. They describe the architecture, explain when it may be used,
  and point out its advantages and disadvantages.
>
> 1. True
> 1. False

**A.** True

## Problem 5

> Language processing systems translate one language into an alternative
  representation of that language.
>
> 1. True
> 1. False

**A.** True

## Problem 6

> An activity diagram shows the interactions between a system and its
  environment.
>
> 1. True
> 1. False

**B.** False

## Problem 7

> Structural models show the organization and architecture of a system. Class
  diagrams are used to define the static structure of classes in a system and
  their association.
>
> 1. True
> 1. False

**A.** True

## Problem 8

> Pipe and filter systems are best suited to batch processing systems and
  embedded systems where there is **a lot of user interaction.**
>
> 1. True
> 1. False

**B.** False

## Problem 9

> Commonly used architectural patterns include model-view-controller, layered
  architecture, repository, client-server, and pipe and filter.
>
> 1. True
> 1. False

**A.** True

## Problem 10

> The choice of architectural style and structure should depend on the
  non-functional requirements of the system.
>
> 1. True
> 1. False

**A.** True
