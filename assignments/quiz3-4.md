# Quiz 3-4: Agile and requirements engineering

## Problem 1

> All agile methods suggest that software should be developed and delivered
  incrementally.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**A.** True

## Problem 2

> Match the principle or practice with their correct descriptions.
>
> - Continuous integration
> - On-site customer
> - Collective ownership
> - Incremental planning

- **C.** The pairs of developers work on all areas of the system, so that no
  islands of expertise develop and all the developers take responsibility for
  all of the code. Anyone can change anything.
- **A.** As soon as the work on a task is complete, it is integrated into the
  whole system. After any such integration, all the unit tests in the system
  must pass.
- **D.** Requirements are recorded on "story cards," and the stories to be
  included in a release are determined by the time available and their relative
  priority. The developers break these stories into development "tasks."
- **B.** A representative of the end-user of the system (the Customer) should be
  available full time for the use of the XP team. In an extreme programming
  process, the customer is a member of the development team and is responsible
  for bringing system requirements to the team for implementation.

## Problem 3

> Match the principle or practice with their correct descriptions.
>
> - Simple Design
> - Small Releases
> - Refactoring
> - Pair Programming

- **D.** Developers work in pairs, checking each other's work and providing the
  support to always do a good job.
- **C.** All developers are expected to refactor the code continuously as soon
  as potential code improvements are found. This keeps the code simple and
  maintainable.
- **A.** Enough design is carried out to meet the current requirements and no
  more.
- **B.** The minimal useful set of functionality that provides business value is
  developed first. Releases of the system are frequent and incrementally add
  functionality to the first release.

## Problem 4

> Test automation is unwanted for test-first development
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**B.** False

## Problem 5

> The functional requirements for a system are constraints on the services or
  functions offered by the system.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**B.** False

## Problem 6

> Non-functional requirements are constraints on the services or functions
  offered by the system.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**A.** True

## Problem 7

> Match the following process activities with their definitions.
>
> - Requirements discovery and understanding
> - Requirements documentation
> - Requirements prioritization and negotiation
> - Requirements classification and organization

- **A.** This is the process of interacting with stakeholders of the system to
  discover their requirements. Domain requirements from stakeholders and
  documentation are also discovered during this activity.
- **D.** This activity takes the unstructured collection of requirements, groups
  related requirements and organizes them into coherent clusters.
- **C.** This activity is concerned with prioritizing requirements and finding
  and resolving requirements conflicts through negotiation.
- **B.** Requirements are documented and input into the next round of the
  spiral. An early draft of the software requirements documents may be produced
  at this stage, or the requirements may simply be maintained informally on
  whiteboards, wikis, or other shared spaces.
