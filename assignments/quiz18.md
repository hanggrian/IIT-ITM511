# Quiz 1: Service-oriented software engineering

## Problem 1

> What type of service composition can be used to create service-oriented
  software that supports business processes?
>
> 1.  Workflow-based service composition
> 1.  Event-driven service composition
> 1.  Rule-based service composition
> 1.  Model-based service composition

**A.** Workflow-based service composition

## Problem 2

> What is the main objective of service-oriented software engineering?
>
> 1.  Building game applications
> 1.  Building desktop applications
> 1.  Building distributed applications using web services
> 1.  Building mobile applications

**C.** Building distributed applications using web services

## Problem 3

> In the context of service-oriented software engineering, what does REST stand
  for?
>
> 1.  RESTful Enterprise Services Technology
> 1.  Representational State Transfer
> 1.  Resource Exchange Standardization Technique
> 1.  Remote Event Subscription Technology

**B.** Representational State Transfer

## Problem 4

> Which of the following is NOT a basic notion introduced in the chapter?
>
> 1.  Service-oriented architecture
> 1.  RESTful services
> 1.  Service engineering
> 1.  Mobile application development

**D.** Mobile application development

## Problem 5

> SOAP-based services are generally easier to develop and maintain than RESTful
  services.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**B.** False

## Problem 6

> What is the key difference between RESTful and SOAP-based services?
>
> 1.  RESTful services are stateful, while SOAP-based services are stateless.
> 1.  RESTful services use XML, while SOAP-based services use JSON.
> 1.  RESTful services are stateless, while SOAP-based services are stateful.
> 1.  RESTful services use JSON, while SOAP-based services use XML.

**C.** RESTful services are stateless, while SOAP-based services are stateful.

## Problem 7

> The service engineering process is an essential part of creating
  service-oriented software.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**A.** True

## Problem 8

> Which of the following is the largest benefit of using service-oriented
  software engineering?
>
> 1.  Increased application performance
> 1.  Decreased development time
> 1.  Reduced software complexity
> 1.  Support for business processes

**D.** Support for business processes

## Problem 9

> Service-oriented architecture is intended to produce reusable web services.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**A.** True
